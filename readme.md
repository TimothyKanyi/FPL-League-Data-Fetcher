# FPL League Data Fetcher

This web application allows you to fetch, view, and download Fantasy Premier League (FPL) league data for any public league. You can specify a range of gameweeks to analyze, see per-gameweek points for all managers, and identify the top scorer(s) for each gameweek.

- **Display Data:** View the league data and gameweek champions directly on the website in neat, scrollable tables.
- **Download Excel:** Download the league data and gameweek champions as an Excel file with two sheets.

## Usage

1. **Run the Flask app:**
    ```sh
    python FplLeague.py
    ```
2. **Open your browser:**  
   Go to `http://localhost:8080` (or the server's IP if deployed).

3. **Enter a league code** (find this on the FPL website), set your desired gameweek range, and use the buttons to fetch or download data.

## Notes

- Only public FPL leagues are supported.
- Gameweek values must be whole numbers between 1 and 38.
- The app uses the official FPL API, so data is as up-to-date as the FPL site.
